# macroexpand-2025

This is the website project for the upcoming Macroexpand-2025 conference.

It is developed as a [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
At the moment, all the relevant content is under the [site](./site) directory.

Later on, when we have data about speakers, schedule, sessions, etc., we will turn it into a data-driven Clojure project as we did with the previous conference.
