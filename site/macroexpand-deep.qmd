## Macroexpand-Deep - the first Clojure AI conference

The Macroexpand-Deep conference focuses the development of reserach around AI systems in Clojure.

Here, by the obviously-vague term 'AI systems', we typically mean systems that involve the composition of deep networks with other components. However, we are open to alternative interpretations, of course.

### Preferred topics
(Please see the [Speakers](./speakers.html) chapter for guidelines.)

* Building systems with LLMs and embeddings
* Testing algorithms in specific scenarios
* Creating and training network architectures
* Understanding trained networks (e.g., mechanistic interpretability)
* New tools and improvements
