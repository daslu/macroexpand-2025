Macroexpand 2025 is a pair of Clojure conferences organised by [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/). They will focus on two high-priority topics on our journey to make Clojure grow to new fields.

These conferences will follow our our conference-making approach that we ðŸŽ¥ [discussed recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6ICeRyXHsI) and developed around the [SciNo Light](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/) conference.
